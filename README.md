### Docker Compose
**Docker compose** reads the value of the smaller containers and runs them. You can also directly change, for example, image in a given container. Save and restart docker compose - following it, it will download the changed version of image directly from the Internet and start it.
* **Data base** 

Various programs can be used to read the data base, for example _PSequel_, _Sequel Pro_.
* **Information from api**

Various programs can be used to read information from api, eg _Postman_

You can also save these containers directly on the computer, then you do not need to use a special program to read them.
